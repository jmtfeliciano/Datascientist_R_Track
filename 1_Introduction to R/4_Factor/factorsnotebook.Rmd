A factor is a data type that can be used to store categorical variables.  

# Basics on Factors:

Suppose we have a vector for sex and see what the factor method does to the vector:

```{r}
# Sex vector
sex_vector <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")

# Convert sex_vector to a factor
factor_sex_vector <- factor(sex_vector)

# Print out factor_sex_vector
factor_sex_vector
```

From the print out above, we can see that `factor_sex_vector` returns an object with the list (M, F, F, M, M) and the levels involved (F, M).
