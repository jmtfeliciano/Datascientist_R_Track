#### Basics of Apply

Apply allows us to simplify tasks by applying all items in a list/vector/matrix to a function without having to write a complicated for loop statement to iterate over the data structure we want to analyze.

#### A Basic Comparison

There's a family of apply function but let us examine `lapply()` and using it to split four data by cutting the semi-colon and making all entries small letters:

```{r}
# vector with pioneers and their birth year
pioneers <- c("GAUSS:1777", "BAYES:1702", "PASCAL:1623", "PEARSON:1857")
# split them using strsplit() and inspect how it looks like before proceeding
split_data <- strsplit(pioneers, ":")
split_data

# now, turn all data into small letters by using lapply() and tolower():
split_low <- lapply(split_data, tolower)
# now reprint the data with small letters
split_low
```

By looking at the latest data, the letters were indeed transformed into small letters.
