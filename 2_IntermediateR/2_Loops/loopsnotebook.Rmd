__Notes:__ Practically similar to Javascript and most OOP languages.

# & and | 

Instead of double && and ||, we use the single version of them. Here's an example R script that utilizes these tools for relational operators.  

```{r}
# The linkedin and last variable are already defined for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
last <- tail(linkedin, 1)

# Is last under 5 or above 10?
last < 5 | last > 10

# Is last between 15 (exclusive) and 20 (inclusive)?
last > 15 & last <= 20
```
