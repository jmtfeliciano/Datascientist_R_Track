### My portfolio

__Purpose:__ This portfolio will demonstrate my knowledge of classification trees.

__What I will show:__  My ability to make a classification tree to create a classification tree model to decide whether or not to approve a loan based on historical data. 

#### My data
    
```{r}
# load needed 'rpart' package
if(require("rpart")) install.packages("rpart")
library("rpart")

# load loans data
loans <- read.csv(file="loans.csv")

#print all the variable names
colnames(loans)

#print variables with some data
head(loans)
```
